This text adventure from Unity Learn is broken 04/11/2018 in Unity 2018.1.0b13

Issues:
"Inventory" Doesn't return the skull, if DisplayIventory is called within the take script it displays the skull
"Use" doesn't seem to work

The text input appears to ignore all text after calling "Examine" on the skull or going to another room.

The exit from the second room is not displayed.

Can't use the exit from the second room.
